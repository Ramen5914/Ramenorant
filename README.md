### VALORANT in Minecraft.

---

## What exactly is this?
Ramenorant is a mod for minecraft forge that aims to bring the game play of Riot Games' VALORANT to minecraft.
The idea for this originally came from Nimsy's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfWTzlaRnp4) where he made basicaly the same thing.
His version was created without minecraft forge and runs on vanilla client which is incredible, but I thought I would create a forge mod that can fully capture all of VALORANT's gameplay.
