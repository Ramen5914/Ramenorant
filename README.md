### VALORANT in Minecraft.

---

## What exactly is this?
Ramenorant is a mod for minecraft forge that aims to bring the game play of Riot Games' VALORANT to minecraft.
The idea for this originally came from Nimsy's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfWTzlaRnp4) where he made basically the same thing.
His version was created without minecraft forge and runs on vanilla client which is incredible, but I thought I would create a forge mod that can fully capture all of VALORANT's gameplay.

## FAQ

### When will this be available for Fabric?
Honestly, I've never made anything for Fabric mod loader so as of now there are no plans to port it over.
If any one wants to port it for me that'd be amazing, make sure to fork this repository and follow my licence.

### Are you going to make this compatible with Minecraft version X?
This mod was started on version 1.19.4, and it will never be ported backwards.
That said, I do plan on keeping this mod updated to work with the latest version of minecraft.
I am actively attending high school though, but I will try to keep releases timely.
