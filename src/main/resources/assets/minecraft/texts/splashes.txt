Don’t get in my way!
Welcome to my world!
Watch this!
Get out of my way!
Let’s go!
Off your feet!
Here comes the party!
Fire in the hole!
They will cower!
The hunt begins!
Come on, let’s go!
Jokes over, you’re dead!
Where is everyone hiding?
I know EXACTLY where you are.
Watch them run!
Scatter!
I am the hunter!
Nowhere to run!
Open up the sky!
Prepare for hellfire!
Your duty is not over!
You will not kill my allies!
Initiated!
You should run!
Seek them out!
I’ve got your trail!
I’ll handle this!
Who’s next!
World divided!
You’re divided!
No one walks away!
You. Are. Powerless.
They are so dead!
You want to play? Let’s play!
Here we go!
Oy! I’m pissed!
Face Your Fear!
Nightmare take them!
Let’s turn the tide!
I suggest you move!
It’s all you, lil’ homie!
Oye! Monster on the loose!
